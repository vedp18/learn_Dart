/// sealed class  -> 
  // Purpose: Defines a class that can only be extended within the same library.
  // Usage: Useful for creating tightly controlled class hierarchies.

/// abstract class ->
  // Purpose: Defines an abstract class that cannot be instantiated directly.
  // Usage: Such classes are used as base classes, and they can contain abstract methods (methods without implementation) or concrete methods (methods with implementation).

/// base class ->
  // Purpose: Restricts the class to only be extended but not implemented or mixed in.
  // Usage: Prevents misuse of a class intended solely for extension in the inheritance hierarchy. 

/// final class ->
  //Purpose: Indicates that the class cannot be extended.
  // Usage: Useful for creating sealed classes where no subclassing is allowed. 

/// interface class ->
  // Purpose: Allows a class to be used as an interface, meaning other classes can implement it.
  // Usage: Interfaces allow multiple inheritance of behavior. 

/// mixin class ->
  // Purpose: Used to define mixins, which are reusable chunks of code that can be added to multiple classes.
  // Usage: Mixins do not define constructors and cannot be instantiated directly.
